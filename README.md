### Hi there 👋

<!--

I am a junior in Francis Lewis High School in New York. I am currently studying for the SAT that I am taking on April 13th 2021. I’m also currently working on organizing my new club at school, redisigning my club's website, and templates for my club's projects on GitHub. I’m looking for help with some cool CSS styling tricks for my website.

I also like startups and am looking forward to make my own company (Project Hacks)! Please contact me if you would like to volunteer or have any questions!

Fun Fact: I love social media. I am a member of the LGBTQ community. I like to eat sushi and chocolate. I just joined [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/) as a club leader a few weeks ago.
