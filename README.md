I am a junior in Francis Lewis High School in New York. I am currently studying for the SAT that I am taking on April 13th 2021. Iâ€™m also currently working on organizing my new club at school, redisigning my club's website, and templates for my club's projects on GitHub. Iâ€™m looking for help with some cool CSS styling tricks for my website.

I also like startups and am looking forward to make my own company (Project Hacks)! Please contact me if you would like to volunteer or have any questions!

Fun Fact: I love networking and social media. I am a member of the LGBTQ community. I like to eat sushi and chocolate. I just joined [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/) as a club leader a few weeks ago.

**Update 3/13/21:**
I forgot to mention that I am also a student with disabilities. I also have an (IEP)[https://www.schools.nyc.gov/learning/special-education/the-iep-process/the-iep] since grade school. I have (hearing loss)[https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hearing-loss/symptoms-causes/syc-20373072] and (Graves Disease)[https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/graves-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20356240].
Oh and I love Scrapbook!
