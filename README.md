I am a junior in Francis Lewis High School in New York. I am currently studying for the SAT that I am taking on April 13th 2021. Iâ€™m also currently working on organizing my new club at school, redisigning my club's website, and templates for my club's projects on GitHub. Iâ€™m looking for help with some cool CSS styling tricks for my website.

I also like startups and am looking forward to make my own company (Project Hacks)! Please contact me if you would like to volunteer or have any questions!

Fun Fact: I love networking and social media. I am a member of the LGBTQ community. I like to eat sushi and chocolate. I just joined [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/) as a club leader a few weeks ago.
